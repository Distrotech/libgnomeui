 *** IMPORTANT *** 

This is a development version of gnome-libs.  You should be using a stable
version, which is available at ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-libs/
The version you just configured is meant for developers of gnome-libs only:

  * You should not base ANY software on this version of gnome-libs.

Distributions should *NOT* ship a development package of this gnome-libs.
Do not ship the headers and do not ship the gnome-config script. These
things will conflict with the stable 1.0 series.  Package only enough
to satisfy the requirements of some other package.  Package only the
library itself.  Doing otherwise will do no favors to the community.

 *** You should be using gnome-libs 1.0 instead. ***

If you are using this source tree from CVS, please run:
	cvs update -r gnome-libs-1-0"
now.

			....
     Do not bother the mailing lists, IRC channels, or other forums if you cannot
     figure out how to build gnome-libs HEAD. It is not in working condition.
