Todo and wishlist for libgnomeui. Please feel free to add, remove, or comment.
You might sync the list to web-devel-2/content/news/status/libs.html 
if you change stuff.

In all cases, if it becomes apparent that the change would break lots of 
stuff, we will have to not change it in this version though we may 
deprecate something.

An overall goal is to ask hard questions about how useful things are 
and reduce some bloat. Also improve elegance and add more truly useful
functionality.

 * There are far too many image-display widgets. We have: GtkPixmap, 
   GnomeStock, GnomePixmap, GtkImage, GnomeStockPixmapWidget, etc.
   Should be fewer widgets with more features per widget. i.e. enhance
   GnomePixmap to handle the GnomeStock case, at a minimum

 * Fold in gdk-pixbuf dependency; remove Imlib

 * Fold in Bonobo dependency

 * Fold in gnome-vfs (move into place or add as dependency?)

 * GnomeFileSelection using Bonobo and gnome-vfs

 * Add/use Nat's new Bonobo-friendly menu stuff

 * Remove at least one keybindings-configurability hack; maybe
   add a good keybindings-configurability feature

 * Remove GtkCauldron (replaced by libglade)

 * Integrate with GnomePrint (i.e. make sure canvas can print,
   make sure print-related widgets are in gnome-print)

 * Font selection widgets that work with gnome-print (GnomeFont)

 * Make canvas able to display GnomeFont

 * Sync to GTK+ 1.4 and glib 1.4 (hopefully not too hard...)

 * libunicode, Pango, etc. should be integrated and put into use.

 * Color selection enhancement (perhaps in GTK, though GTK can't do 
   a "custom palette" if we want that since it lacks the config 
   database)

 * Fix antialiased canvas

 * Make libgnorba display-independent, and some other enhancements
   as Elliot the CORBA dude sees fit

 * Add a context help thing (like Windows' "What's this", or GtkTipsQuery)

 * Fix up gnome_init() with something more extensible/customizable

 * Remove or fully implement gnome-app-util.h

 * Remove gnome-dns.h? I think there's another library that may be better.
   For that matter gnome-vfs may handle this problem.

 * Remove obsolete gnome-font-selector, replaced by GtkFontSelection

 * Remove GnomeGuru, replaced by GnomeDruid

 * Remove gnome-pixmap-entry (I think, maybe I mean GnomeIconSel, one 
   of these things is deprecated IIRC)

 * Remove gnome-less (too pointless) 

 * Remove gnome-number-entry (ditto)

 * Remove gnome-preferences.[hc] ?

 * Remove gnome-properties.[hc] ? 

 * Remove gnome-property-entries.[hc] ?

 * Remove gnome-spell

 * Remove gnome-startup if possible

 * Remove gtk-ted

 * Consider a new property box, addressing some problems:
    - shouldn't be required to have a notebook if there's only 
      one page
    - should have try/revert like the control center

 * We need stock icons for try/revert

 * update gnome-winhints to reflect new window manager spec

 * Use AbiWord centerDialog function in gnome_dialog_set_parent(),
   it's nicer than the dumb thing GnomeDialog does

 * Add object arguments to all GtkObject's in the library

 * Add gnome-popup-menu and gnome-popup-help menu creation variants
   that leave the user_data in the GnomeUIInfo struct

 * Fix bugs!
