  <title>The GTK Ted widget</title>
  <para>
    The purpose of this widget (at this point, it is not really a
    widget. but shouyld be soon) is to facilitate the creation of user
    interfaces by C programmers.
  <para>
    Exising GUI designers either generate source code from a form
    design which can not be edited and later regenerated or are very
    complex to allow two way editing. 
  <para>
    The approach taken by the Ted widget is very simple:  Ted is
    <literal>GtkContainer</literal> at which widgets are thrown out,
    just like a regular container.  The only difference is that you
    have to use the <literal>gtk_ted_add</literal> routine, which
    expects every widget to have a string name associated to it.  
  <para>
    Ted expects the programmer to create his widgets in the source
    code and passing names to the <literal>gtk_ted_add</literal>
    routine.  After the widgets are created, and before attempting to
    use the Ted container, the <literal>gtk_ted_prepare</literal>
    routine should be invoked.  
  <para>
    The first time Ted is used on a new dialog box, it will find out
    that there is no layout information defined for the current dialog
    box (the dialog box name is passed initially to the
    <literal>gtk_ted_new</literal> routine).  And will thus invoke the
    Ted GUI editor.  The programmer, can then drag and drop the
    widgets in the proper locations in the form.  Once the widgets are
    placed in the desired places, and any further decorations have
    been added (the programmer can also add frames and separators to
    the dialog box without creating them in his source file), the
    programmer just clicks on the <literal/Save/ button and the layout
    information would then be stored.
  <para>
    On the next invocation of the dialog box, Ted, will look in the
    application specific layout directory for layout information (see
    the source code for details) for the layout information.  If no
    layout information is present there, it will try loading the file
    "layout" from the current directory and use that to place the
    widgets from the dialog box.
  <para>
    If new widgets are added to a dialog box, Ted will automatically
    switch into GUI-design mode, to let the programmer place the new
    widgets. 
  <para>
    It is also possible to modify the layout of an existing dialog
    box, to achive this, it is necesarry to set the environment
    variable <literal/TEDIT/ to the name of the dialog box that you
    want to modify and invoke the program.
